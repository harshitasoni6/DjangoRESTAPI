API => Application Programming Interface
It acts as a two-way communication bridge b/w frontend and backend

REST API => Representational State Transfer
It organizes how web Applications talk to each other,
seperating what the user sees(frontend) from
what runs behind the scenes(backend).

Core Principles of REST
Stateless:
The server doesn't store any information about
the client b/w requests.
Client-Server Architecture:
The app(client) asks for things(data) and th server does
what's requested(sends data or make changes).
